						<h2>Personality Test</h2>
						<p>The test done by 16Personalities is one of the very few which come close to being considered accurate. 
						I've done this test multiple times and my test result has always been the same. 
						My type is Mediator as a creative mostly involved in the creative industry as I do believe so as Iâ€™m currently doing IT with a minor in Multimedia.
