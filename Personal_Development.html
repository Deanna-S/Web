								<li>Kindness, Iâ€™ve considered it one of the many strengths I have as it is something everyone needs. 
								Over the years, I have been doing my best to hold on to this innate kindness. </li>
								</br>
								<li>Building relations, I have met many people over the years of growing up and 
								I have done my best to keep in contact with as many as possible as building relations and building connections is important throughout life. </li>
								</br>
								<li>Understanding towards others, I have done my best to understand and recognize everyone is different from the other 
								and that you have to apply different ways of understanding situations. Even if it's research or even just plain asking, it's a skill I have honed over the years. </li>

						<h1>Twelve Pillars</h1>
						<p>
						Based on my understanding, starting from chapter 4, when setting your goals, when you set them youself which could be used to for myself is doing things for myself instead of others
						as doing them yourself makes it even more satisfying. Soon going into chapter 5, opportunites are plenty yet they will always be only one which is best. There maybe regret when you miss a choice
						and not get the best however that holds no importance to when you know where you plan to go. Chapter 6, be mindful of who you mingle with which could be applied to my friend group
						as they can influence you in any way. Chapter 7 appplies to my current life situation, I'm in university gaining a formal education as I am going to make a living however learning on my own and teaching 
						myself holds so much more weight compared to the normal.
